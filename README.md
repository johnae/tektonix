### Tektonix: A Nix module for Tekton Pipelines

This is an early draft of a [tekton](https://tekton.dev/) pipeline generation system using [Nix](https://nixos.org). It's so early that you may not want to try it at all. It doesn't support all features of Tekton Pipelines (yet) and I don't know if it's something I'll use myself even. That said, here it is.
